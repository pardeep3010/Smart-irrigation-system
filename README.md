# Smart-Irrigation-System
This project demonstrates a smart irrigation system designed to efficiently water plants using real-time environmental data. The system integrates temperature and humidity sensors (DHT11/DHT22), a soil moisture sensor, a relay module for controlling a water pump, and a motion sensor for optional security or automation features.
